Repository to add cryptographic hash functions, such as MD2, RSA, and others. They can be used as Python modules in any project. 

## MD2 

Although it was broken long time ago, MD2 can be used in internal communications or for personal projects, where you want to encrypt something in order to be safer.

## RSA

This is one of the most used cryptographic hash functions nowadays, for financial transactions, digital signature, etc.
